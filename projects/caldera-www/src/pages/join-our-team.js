        <p>
          Weâ€™re group of people with a particular set of skills that come
          together to craft great outcomes. All of our employees are
          contractors, and many folks have their own freelance gigs on the side.
          This creates a unique dynamic â€“ giving both personal goals and shared
          goals some time in the limelight. We work to bring you opportunities
          to engage with challenging projects and to open you up to a network of
          talented people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our projects consist of anything and everything within the digital
          landscape. Our tasks are constantly evolving, so weâ€™re always looking
          for coders, copywriters, visual designers, musicians, social media
          gurus, user experience experts, photographers, bloggers, chefs,
          videographers and everything in-between (SEO bots do your thang). If
          you have a skill that can be tailored to the internet - we want to
          hear from you.
